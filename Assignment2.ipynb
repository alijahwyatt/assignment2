        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? The paper is about tidying and how it's used to make data cleaning easy and effective.\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? To facilitate exploration and analysis of data, and simplify the development of data analysis tools that work together.\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" The first sentence means if a datasets are tidy, they all share the same similar qualities of a tidy dataset. However, if they are messy, each dataset can have different qualities or things wrong with them that another messy dataset might not have. The second sentence means when looking at dataset, it's usually easy to see what variables are being measured versus the observations gathered. However, in general, defining something as a variable versus an observation can be difficult.\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations? A value is either a number or string which belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3? Tidy Data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset? The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are column headers are values, not variable names, multiple values are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 are messy because the variables form both columns and rows, and the column headers are values, not variable names. Melting a dataset is turning its columns into rows.\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"? Table 11 is messy because it has variables spread across rows and columns and the element column isn't a variable. Table 12(a) is molten because id, month, and year were molted with element. Table 12(b) is tidy because there is one variable in each column, and each row represents a day's observations.\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling? It's if tidy data is only useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools with be linked with tiny data, making it easy to get stuck in a local maxima where independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve the workflow."

The government can get a better understanding of the nation's diversity.

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data? The Census included multiple responses for identifying race, allowing for more diverse responses. However, the addition of \"Some other race\" can lead to underrepresentation of races which weren't answer choices. To reflect the diversity of the population, surveys should allow an option to type what race people identify with. Furthermore, the Census should continue and provide incentives for collecting data in undercounted areas.\n",

What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why? Concerns have to be to ensure privacy of individuals. Challenges can include if values are missing, then that could lead to biases when making decisions based on that data. A good practice might be being transparent regarding how missing data is handled, whereas a bad practice might be making assumptions about the missing data that negatively impact people's identities and lead to bias.\n",
